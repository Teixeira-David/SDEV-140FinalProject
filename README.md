# SDEV-140FinalProject
Fire Extinguisher Final Project

This is the final project for SDEV-140. The project is designed to allow a user to log into the program and conduct a Fire Extinguisher inpsection. The data is then validated and passed to a SQL database file that uses MSSQL 2017-2019. There is a requirements text page and an import requirements py file that must be initailzed prior to starting the program in order for the user to have a virtural enviornment that holds all of the local python libraries required for this assignment. I would adivse to run the file (importrequirements.py) first to install pip libraries to your local machine, then start the program. 

In order for the tester to play with the database users, please refer to the INSERT table TLogins for the required passwords inside the db in order to login. There are disabled buttons that do not have functionality as a whole as this program was submitted without full completetion, but after looking at the project requirements, I believe I have exceeded what was expected of the student. 

Project Requirements:

1. A working GUI tkinter application with at least two windows.   50 points
2. Implementing a modular approach in your application. 10 points
3. Consistent clear navigation throughout the GUI application.   10 points
4. Use at least two images in your application(images should have alternate text).  10 points
5. Include at least three labels. 10 points
6. Include at least three buttons. 10 points
7. Include at least three call back function with each button, including exit button. 20 points
8. Implement secure coding best practices, including input validation to check if the user entered the correct data type, make sure the entry box is not empty, etc.   10 points
9. Validation testing - 20 points.  Develop an appropriate set of test data to fully validate the program against.
  a. the data sets you tested against.
  b. a brief written explanation of the results of your tests and what you had to fix.
  c. screen shots of your good test data working.

10. User manual creation - 20 points.  You will write and submit a User's manual for your final project and submit it according to the instructions in the attached file.
11. Documentation of source code - 20 points.  You will fully document (comment) the corrected Python tkinter source code with appropriate comments including:
  a. A brief explanation of the purpose of each module (Sub) at the beginning of each Sub. (A header's comment)
  b. Explanation of the purpose of each variable where it is declared. (An end line comment)
  c. Line by line, or at least section by section comments within the code, explaining what the line/section does. 
12. The link of the GitHub repository for your final project. 10 points
